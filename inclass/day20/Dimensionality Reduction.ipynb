    "## Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you have read through Jake Vanderplas' notebook on [dimensionality reduction](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2015/blob/master/notebooks/04.1-Dimensionality-PCA.ipynb).  Here, we will expand on some of the ideas presented in the notebook.  First, we'll drill down into the underlying mathematics of principal components analysis (PCA), we'll apply PCA to some non-digit data (gasp), and then we'll move to non-linear dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ with each $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$.  We'd like to find the most \"important dimensions\" in the data.  Here are some criteria that we can use to operationalize this notion of importance:\n",
    "1.  Compress the data to a fixed size while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
    "2.  Maximize the variance of the data when projected into this reduced space.\n",

    "### Linear Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's make the problem a little simpler.  Let's consider the case where the mean of the dataset for each of the d-dimensions is zero.  We can accomplish this by simply computing the mean across all of the points $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and then subtracting the mean from each point to create a new, zero-mean dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the task of reducing our dataset to a single number for each data point.  Specifically, we will consider schemes that project all datapoints onto a vector $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of our goal is that we'd like to choose a $v$ that preserves as much of the original information in the data as possible.  A sensible way to define this preservation of information is to look at the squared error between the projection onto $v$ and the original data point.  The projection of a point onto a vector $v$ can be understood geometrically using this picture (source [Wikipedia entry on Vector Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection)).\n",

    "\n",
    "This is starting to shape up, but we don't know what $\\theta$ is.  In order to do this we will have to apply the following fact about dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot b = |a| |b| \\cos \\theta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $cos \\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{|a||b|}$.  From our picture above, we know that the vector we'd like to compute is $B |A| \\cos \\theta$.  Another way to write the dot-product of $A$ and $B$ is as a vector-vector multiplication: $A^\\top B$.  Substituing in our formula for $\\cos \\theta$ yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "B |A| \\cos \\theta &= B |A| \\frac{A^\\top B}{|A||B|} \\\\\n",
    "&= B \\frac{A^\\top B}{|B|} \\\\\n",
    "&= B \\frac{B^\\top A}{|B|}, \\mbox{note: dot product is commutative}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can define the squared error for a particular choice of $v$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left |v \\frac{v^\\top x_i}{|v|}- x_i \\right|^2 \\enspace .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is clear is that the magnitude of $v$ doesn't really have any effect on the reconstruction error.  Therefore, we can restrict ourselves to looking for vectors $v$ that are unit vectors.  This simplifies our formula for the reconstruction error to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left | v v^\\top x_i - x_i \\right|^2 \\enspace .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The squared magnitude of a vector, $|u|^2$, can be computed as $u^\\top u$.  We can now write the reconstruction error as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left ( v v^\\top  x_i - x_i \\right )^\\top \\left ( v v^\\top  x_i - x_i \\right )$$\n",
    "$$ =x_i^\\top v v^\\top v v^\\top x_i - 2x_i^\\top v v^\\top x_i + x_i^\\top x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $v$ is a unit vector, $v^\\top v = 1$.  Our reconstrution can be further simplied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "&= x_i^\\top v v^\\top x_i - 2x_i^\\top v v^\\top x_i + x_i^\\top x_i \\\\\n",

    "&= \\sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^\\top x_i  - \\sum_{i=1}^n v^\\top x_i x_i^\\top v \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^\\top x_i  - v^\\top \\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n  x_i x_i^\\top \\right ) v\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last equation is simply the definition of the maximum Eigenvalue of the matrix $\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n  x_i x_i^\\top \\right )$ (also known as the [Rayleigh coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient)).  The maximum Eigenvalue of this matrix can be computed easily using a numerical solver.  This gives us the first principal component.  If you want more principal components, you simply subtract out the reconstruction of the original data using the first principal component and repeat the procedure defined above on this transformed data."
